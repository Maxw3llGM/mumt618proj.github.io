    <p>To obtain the resulting clarinet model, the parameter values used are:</p>

        <center><strong>Figure 12:</strong>With these results the generated sound approaches that of an actual
            clarinet. </center>

    </p>

    <p>To obtain a more natural sound, an envelope is applied to the mouth
        pressure values ramping it from 0 to
        $\mu H\left( 2\pi f_{r} \right)^{2}$ in approximately 100 milliseconds.
        Noise and vibrato are also added for similar reasons.</p>
    <p>By changing the variables $H,\mu$ it affects the rate at which the
        resulting pressure will ramp but beware that it will also affect the
        upper harmonics of the sound. Reducing $H$ will reduce $u_{0}$ which
        leads to a reduction of $p_{\Delta}$ which results in a removal of
        energy in the higher harmonics due too the reed filter. Inversely,
        increasing the reed&#39;s dynamic mass per area will have the same effect as
        $H$ as it affects the numerator of the filter,
        $\frac{4z^{- 1}}{\mu_{r}}$.</p>
    <p>To have the clarinet model play non-integer-based frequencies and
        compare it properly with the stk toolkit version, I implemented an
        interpolated delay line.</p>
    <p>With some tunning of the note&#39;s frequency, I was able to line up the
        sounds rather well resulting in:</p>

    <center> <strong>Figure 13:</strong>
        Frequency response between the tuned matlab and stk model</center>

    <p>
        As we can see in figure 11 and 12, the frequency responses resemble, however
        the resulting sounds differ in their amplitude envelope. The amplitude
        variation in the stk model is most likely due to the applied reverb, a
        ramped down envelope, and the difference in reed models. When attempting
        to apply a downwards ramping envelope on the mouth pressure in my model,
        it created issues with the filters returning imaginary numbers and blowing up the values. Hence
        why there is only an envelope on the upwards motion.
