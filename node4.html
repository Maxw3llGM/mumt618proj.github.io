    <p>The results of the presented clarinet model have been shown. When
        compared to the stk model, the frequency response de resemble, however
        the resulting sounds differ in their amplitude envelope. The amplitude
        variation in the stk model is most likely due to the applied reverb, a
        ramped down envelope, and the difference in reed models. When attempting
        to apply a downwards ramping envelope on the mouth pressure in my model,
        it created issues with the filters returning imaginary numbers. Hence
        why there is only an envelope on the upwards motion.</p>
    <p>The stk version also utilises a reedtable [] as the reed&#39;s
        implementation. In turn, it is coupled to a cylindrical tube model whose
        delay lines are combined and the one zero reflection filter is commuted
        to the end of the delay line. This in turn makes the model more
        computationally efficient by taking advantage of approximations being
        made to the model.</p>
