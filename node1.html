        The purpose of this project was to learn how to implement a waveguide based clarinet model using methods seen in class. 
        I accomplished my task by implementing the stable reed filter model from week nine coupled with the cylindrical model of week 8. 
        The physical values found in this report were obtained from 
        <a href="ref.html#guillemain:jasa05">Guillemain et&nbsp;al. (2005)</a> and 
        <a href="ref.html#scavone:thesis">Scavone (1997)</a>

        As my main instrument is the clarinet, I wished to learn about the physics involved in its sound generation. 
        Thank to this class and my final project, I was able achieve just that.

        Now let’s start by going through a quick review of the clarinet modules.

<h2> Cylindrical air column</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The cylindrical air column is a type of resonator that utilizes its shape as a feedback system to sustain specific 
            frequencies within a sound oscillating through it. By varying its tube length, the air column can play different 
            frequencies.The length must not vary the timbre of the sound, in other words the ratio between the 1st and consequent harmonics of the sound. 
            The wave propagation within the column is planar, and so can simply be represented by a one dimensional wave equation. 
            <p></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            The transverse modes do exist within the waves motion, however the cylindrical bore only weakly excites them. 
            More can be learned about this effect in <a href="ref.html#scavone:thesis">Scavone (1997)</a>.
            Hence if we are to represent the cylindrical bore as a waveguide model it would look like this:
            <p></p>
        </li>

        <li>
            The two delay lines would represent the wave’s motion propagating down the air column and back. 
            <p></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            The shorter the length, the shorter the delay line. Once the pressure wave reaches the end of the pipe at x = L, and so we must calculate the reflection coefficient of the sound R_L with first or second order filter. Generally, the reflection function is:

            <p></p>
        </li>

        <li>
            Where Z_L is the load impedance at the end of the tube and Z_c is the characteristic impedance of the 
            cylindrical bore.

            <p></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            The characteristic impedance can be determined by:

            <p></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Where P is the equation of motion of the pressure wave and U it’s volume flow equivalent. 
            So, we notice that Z_c is dependent on the mass density of air rho speed of sound c and the 
            cross-sectional area of the cylinder. 

            <p></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            The Load impedance is determined numerically, however we have some edge cases we can discuss, 
            when the cylinder is an open end, Z_L=0 and R_L= -1 which means complete reflectance with inversion.
             When Z_L=∞ then R_L= 1, complete reflection of the wave without inversion.
            <p></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Once we have determined these values, we can compute the pressure directly at any point in the model. 
            However, to save on computation power we only need to compute the pressure response at the entrance of the air column 
            at x = 0 by the introduction of either a unitary pressure impulse at the entrance to the model (Z_c δ[n]) which 
            returns the impulse response h(t) or a continual pressure input from an excitation source like a reed model.
