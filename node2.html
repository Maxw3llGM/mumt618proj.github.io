    <h1 id="method">Method</h1>
    <p>As the cylindrical model has already been implement in one of the
        classes assignments, I will first focus on implementing the reed model.</p>
    <h2 id="reed-model-1">Reed Model</h2>
    <p>It is mainly comprised of two parts, the stable reed filter, and the
        volume flow equation both discussed in the intro.</p>
    <p>
        <img src="./images/media/image41.png" alt="" class="center" width="50%">
        <center><strong>Figure 5:</strong> Functions for the stable reed function and volume flow.</center>
    </p>
    <p>Within the main loop</p>
    <p>The reed filter will take the pressure difference ($p\Delta$) that was has
        calculated one sample before. Since the filter will only receive one
        sample at a time I employ $z_f$ and $z_l$ to save the filters values (more
        specifically the position of the reed). These are concidered the filters
        initial and final conditions. Let&#39;s say we have a filter:</p>
    <p><img src="./images/media/image32.png" alt="" class="center small_equation" width="25%"></p>
    <p>We are not saving the values of $y\lbrack n - 1\rbrack$ and
        $y\lbrack n - 2\rbrack$ at the output. $Z_l$ and $Z_f$ will instead do that
        for you, where $z_l$ is used as the input and $z_f$ is it resulting output.</p>
    <p>To find out that the constantes of the filter were correct, I ploted
        their graph out anc compared to values found in Gary&#39;s paper []</p>
    <p><img src="./images/media/image33.png" alt="" class="center" width="35%">
        <img src="./images/media/image34.png" alt="" class="center" width="35%">
        <center><strong>Figure 6:</strong> Implemented Stable Reed Filters Frequency and impulse response.</center>
    </p>
    <p><img src="./images/media/image35.png" alt="" class="center">
        <center><strong>Figure 7:</strong> Comparison graph with figure 6 from ___.</center>
    </p>
    <p>As we can see the values do coincide which yield to believe the reed
        filter is properly modeled.</p>
    <p>Once we have determiend y, we can pass it into the volume flow function.
        This will also take the mouth pressure that we had determined in the
        intro and the incoming pressure value from down the cylindrical tube p-.
        If y + H &lt; 0 then the reed opening is set to be closed and the volume
        flow is set to 0. Otherwise we compute the explicit solution mentioned
        in the intro.</p>
    <p>Now that we have computed the volume flow we can scale it by $Z_c$ and pass
        it into the cylindrical model.</p>
    <h2 id="cylindrical-model">Cylindrical Model</h2>
    <p><img src="./images/media/image3.png" class="center" height="30%" width="55%">
        <center><strong>Figure 8:</strong> Digital waveguide model of a closed-open cylindrical bore.</center>
    </p>
    </p>
    <p>To implement the cylindrical Model, I simply used two delay lines that
        are looped through whose length is determined by the invers ratio
        between the frequency being played and the sampling frequency. There is
        only one pointer that keeps track of the position through the bore but
        that also wraps around when reaching the end of the delay lines. The
        length of the bore is represented with the note that is to be played and
        the area is set to 0.008 meters as that is the value used to determine
        numerically the reflection function values that are used here from
        another assignment. The characteristic impedance is determined with
        $Z_{c} = \frac{\rho c}{\pi r^{2}}$.</p>
    <h2 id="basic-clarinet-model">Basic Clarinet model</h2>

    <p>
        <img src="./images/media/image43.png" class="center" width="50%"></p>
        <center><strong>Figure 9:</strong> A complete Digital waveguide clarinet model. $f$ is the bilinear stable reed filter 
            and $U_0$ is the volume flow equation.</center>
    </p>
    <p>Putting both sections together the basic model is as such:</p>
    <p>The resulting pressure is determined by the incoming and outgoing
        pressure at the input:</p>
    <p><img src="./images/media/image36.png" alt="Shape Description automatically generated with medium
confidence" class="center" width="13%"></p>
    <p>It is important to be aware of the order in which values are saved and
        written to in delay lines. Here is the basic algorithm of the model:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Save the incoming pressure value $p^{-}$,</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Compute the reed&#39;s position using $p\Delta$ that was computed one
                cycle before</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Compute the resulting volume flow from the reed using the mouth
                pressure $p_{m}$, the incoming pressure $p^{-}$ and the previously
                computed position $y$,</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Compute the input into the incoming delay line using the output of
                the outgoing delay line</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Compute and insert the value into the outgoing delay line</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Compute the resulting pressure $p_{0}$</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Compute the new $p\Delta$</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Procedures [2,3] and 4 can be inversed with no consequences as they
        are not dependent on each other.</p>
    <p><img src="./images/media/image37.png" alt="" class="center" width="25%">
        <center><strong>Figure 10:</strong> Implemented Main delay line loop.</center>
    </p>
    <p>As we see here, we must extract the outgoing values of each delay line
        first before inserting the new values into them as they occupy the same
        position respectively. As such, order is important. There are also
        creative ways to avoid using temporary variables. In this case, when
        saving $p^{-}$ I store it in $p_{0}$ as it&#39;s value will not be updated
        until step 6. And to avoid having to compute step 5 twice as that same
        value is used in step 6 in $p_{0},$ we can simply reuse the value from
        step 5.</p>
